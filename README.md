3)	GIT_EX1.R

This is the code that served as the foundation for the project.
The user must download this code into R and then load the appropriate library packages.
Each of the packages shown were publicly available and all aided in the development of this work.
The code reads an excel file (attached below) into R.
The user selects the appropriate tests by uncommenting/commenting the appropriate variables and variable.types as shown in the code.
The code produces the appropriate distance matrix, scaled and unscaled, as well as the resulting performance metrics for the test.
The results from this code may be verified and validated using by comparing to the manual calculations in the excel spreadsheet.

4)	Simul_D1.1.xlsx

The first tab in this file contains the raw data to be used by the R code.
The subsequent tabs walk through the manual calculations for centroidal, symbolic, centroidal with categorical and symbolic with categorical.
